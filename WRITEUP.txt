•4) letter tiles in the player’s “hand” are selected randomly from a data structure with the proper distribution of the letters (code!)

	Working it using a random number generating function and placing them the rack for the user


• (4) letter tiles can be dragged-and-dropped onto target Scrabble squares

	Working but because I used droppable instead of sortable it can be kinda weird sometimes and might required a restart of the browser.

• (4) program identifies which letter tile is dropped onto which Scrabble square

	Working the tile is placed into a array that is then parsed into a string

• (4) board includes at least two bonus squares

	Yes the board contains two double word squares that make the value of the tile multiply itself by two.

• (4) score is tallied correctly, including consideration of bonus square multipliers

	Yes it is tallied correctly and is display in the top of the window and also saves the highest word score generated 

• (3) any number of words can be played until the player wishes to quit or depletes all tiles

	Yes it is working and is tracked but not displayed to the user.

• (3) the board is cleared after each round so that a new word can be played

	Yes the board is cleared on a restart or on clear rack but keeps the remaining tiles on submit word 

• (3) after playing a word, only the number of letter tiles needed to bring the player’s “hand” back to 7 tiles are selected

	Yes working on submit tiles.

• (3) score is kept for multiple words until the user restart a new game (implement next vs. restart)

	Yes working.
• (2) Tiles can only be dragged from the “rack” to Scrabble board. If the user drop them anywhere else, they will be bounced back to the “rack”.

	Yes but is glitchy with keeping score if you drag a tile away from the scrabble board and it bounces back the score for that letter might not be counted have to be precise.

• (2) Once the tile is placed on the Scrabble board, it can be moved back to the “rack”.

	Yes it can.

• (2) Except for the first letter, all sub-subsequent letters must be placed directly next to or below another letter with no space. Else, they will bounce back to the “rack”.
	No not working I once again think I would need to implement a sortable board to make this feature easier
• (2) user can always restart the game.
	Yes wit the restart Game button.
